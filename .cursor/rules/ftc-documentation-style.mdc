Audience

Write for an extremely broad audience:

High school freshmen with limited technical exposure

Students from low-income or under-resourced programs

Mentors, engineers, and robotics professionals with decades of experience

Assume intelligence, not prior knowledge.

Never talk down to the reader, but never assume familiarity with jargon.

Tone

Clear, neutral, and respectful

Confident but not authoritative or academic

Supportive and welcoming, without motivational fluff

Professional, but human

Diction

Prefer plain, direct language over complex or academic phrasing

Avoid buzzwords, hype, or marketing-style language

Define technical terms only when necessary

Avoid slang, but do not sound formal or legalistic

Content Principles

Eliminate all fluff, filler, and redundant explanations

Preserve explanations that provide:

Conceptual clarity

Practical understanding

Context that prevents confusion or misuse

If a sentence does not add new information or clarity, remove it

Structure

Short paragraphs

Clear section headers

Logical progression from concept → purpose → application

Use lists where they improve readability, but avoid over-fragmentation

Inclusivity & Accessibility

Avoid assumptions about:

Prior schooling

Access to tools or funding

Native language proficiency

Use examples that are broadly relatable

Avoid cultural references that assume shared background knowledge

Editing Rules

Combine repetitive ideas into a single, strong explanation

Prefer one clear explanation over multiple rephrasings

Remove emotional padding (“This is very important…”, “You should definitely…”)

Let clarity, not emphasis, convey importance
